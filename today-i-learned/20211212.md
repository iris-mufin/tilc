## How do I get a better Activity Score by tomorrow than today
- I worked yesterday until 11:00 am, so I woke up at 4:00 pm then went to the office; I was so tired I could not find a method recovering my energy. So I spent many hours watching non-study-contents.
Fortunately, I never click on Korean content. So I am no more getting pressured for English content. So tomorrow I could do get a better activity score.
