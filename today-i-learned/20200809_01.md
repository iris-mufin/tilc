## Remove The Bitnami Badge

By default, the Bitnami WordPress Stack has a Bitnami badge at the bottom left corner of the welcome page.

Clicking this badge displays a page with information about the installed application and links to documentation. While this is useful when you first deploy WordPress and are trying it out, you should remove it once your WordPress blog/site starts receiving “real” visitors.

To remove the Bitnami badge, follow these steps:

- [Log in to the server using SSH](https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/how-to/get-started-wordpress-aws-marketplace-intermediate/#connect-to-the-wordpress-server-using-ssh).
- Execute the following command:

```jsx
sudo /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/bnconfig --disable_banner 1
```

Finish.
