# Today I Learned

## fork and pull and follow github standad 

오늘은 왜 깃허브의 fork and pull을 스탠다드로 생각하고 참고를 해야하는지 에 대해서 알아보고자 합니다.

"Whether you're trying to give back to the open source community or collaborating on your own projects, knowing how to properly fork and generate pull requests is essential. Unfortunately, it's quite easy to make mistakes or not know what you should do when you're initially learning the process. I know that I certainly had considerable initial trouble with it, and I found a lot of the information on GitHub and around the internet to be rather piecemeal and incomplete - part of the process described here, another there, common hangups in a different place, and so on.

In an attempt to coallate this information for myself and others, this short tutorial is what I've found to be fairly standard procedure for creating a fork, doing your work, issuing a pull request, and merging that pull request back into the original project."

한 마디로 요약하자면 : github를 포함하여 불완전하고 파편적인 레퍼런스로인해 공해가 생기는것을 방지하고, 좋은 레퍼런스들(프로제트)이 많아 질수있도록.
몇가지를 간단한 사항들을 스탠다드로 따라하자 라는 이야기 입니다. 

순서는 차이는 있지만 거의 비슷함으로서 2가지 링크를 공유합니다.
